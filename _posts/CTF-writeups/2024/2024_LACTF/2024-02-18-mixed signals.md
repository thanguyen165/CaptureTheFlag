[message.wav](https://chall-files.lac.tf/uploads/1f51a78729bade2ad246ff9ee1940b5d82afd274d36b60f1fd319028d65727d3/message.wav)

## Solution

Actually the author uploads wrong file, that makes this challenge so easy.

Just hear the audio, and use [nato phonetic alphabet](https://www.worldometers.info/languages/nato-phonetic-alphabet/) to decode.

The flag is
```
lactf{c4n_y0u_plz_unm1x_my_s1gn4lz}
```
