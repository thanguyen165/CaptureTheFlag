* Tag: Easy

## Description
> Just make 1337 (again)
> ```sh
> nc byuctf.xyz 40001
> ```

### Attached

```python
import re

FLAG = open('flag.txt').read()

inp = input('> ')

if re.search(r'[123456789]', inp) or re.search(r'\(', inp) or eval(inp) != 1337:
    print('Nope')
else:
    print(FLAG)
```

## Analyzation

We cannot use 123456789, and the open parenthese. Oh wait, the 0 digit has not been blocked!!!

## Solution

Hexadecimal will work:
```sh
0xfed - 0xaaa - 0xa
```

The flag is:
```
byuctf{aaaaaaand_more_simple_bypasses_:)}
```
